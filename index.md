# Student Project  

### Project Introduction

​	`PaperReview` is a group project assigned to the maser students taking the software engineering course in Fudan University. It implements basic academic conference management functionalities such as conference creation, paper submission, review, and rebuttal.  We choose two microservice versions finished by two different groups, called [Version A](https://github.com/FudanSELab/SEIP-ICSE2022-TraceAnalysis/tree/main/Version%20A) and [Version B](https://github.com/FudanSELab/SEIP-ICSE2022-TraceAnalysis/tree/main/Version%20B).

​	The development programming languages of the two versions are `Java` and `Node.js`.The development frameworks of the system are `Spring Boot` and `Spring Cloud`.

### Deployment

​	The two versions can be deployed `locally`, via `Docker Compose`, or via `Kubernetes`.
